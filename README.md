N-Body Simulation: Fast Multipole Method (FMM) vs Barnes-Hut Method

Overview

This repository contains implementations of two efficient algorithms for studying pairwise interactions in N-body systems:
Fast Multipole Method (FMM)
Barnes-Hut Method

These methods significantly reduce the computational complexity of N-body simulations from the naive O(N * N) to O(N * logN), making them more suitable for large-scale simulations.

The repository also includes performance comparisons of the two methods on different tasks and scenarios to demonstrate their efficiency and scalability.
